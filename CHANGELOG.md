# Changelog

All notable changes to `@uluops/setup` will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **`@uluops/agent-metrics` global-install detection no longer false-positives under `npx`.** v0.7.0's `defaultAgentMetricsExecutor.detect` ran `spawnSync("agent-metrics", ["--version"])` to decide whether to skip the global install. But `@uluops/agent-metrics` is a runtime dependency of `@uluops/setup` itself (used by `findMetricsSource` to resolve files to copy), so when setup runs under `npx @uluops/setup`, npx prepends its transient cache `.bin/` to PATH for the spawned process — the bin resolves there even when the user has nothing installed globally. Detect returned "0.4.0", setup reported "already installed — no change", user hit `command not found` after npx exited. Detect now queries npm directly via `npm ls -g --depth=0 --json` and parses the result, answering the actual question ("is it in the user's global install") instead of a PATH-resolution proxy. Pure JSON-parsing logic split out as `parseGlobalAgentMetricsVersion` for direct unit coverage. 5 regression tests added covering: package-present, package-absent (empty + no-deps shapes), unrelated-deps-only, version-field-missing, and unparseable-stdout. The companion `@uluops/cli` flow does NOT have this bug because setup doesn't depend on `@uluops/cli` transitively; its detect is left as-is.
- **`--help` and `--uninstall` now work for users with a malformed `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.** The opencode harness module previously ran a module-load IIFE that threw on a non-absolute or traversal-containing `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` — and the throw fired during `harnesses/index.ts` imports for every CLI entry point, blocking the user from running the very commands they would need to recover. Validation is now deferred to harness selection: the module loads with a fallback path, the error is captured, and `assertOpencodeEnvironment()` is invoked from `getProfile("opencode")` only when the user actually targets opencode. Selecting an unrelated harness (or running `--help`, `--uninstall` of claude-code, etc.) is now unblocked. Surfaced by ship-pipeline code-auditor on `uluops-setup` run #19 as PRA-CON/H.
- **`checkMcpPackageAvailability` now surfaces the real network failure reason** instead of a literal "unknown" string. The previous `?? "unknown"` fallback could put `unknown` into the missing-packages list, producing the unactionable warning `npm packages not found in registry: unknown`. Per-index correspondence between `Promise.allSettled` results and `MCP_PACKAGES` is now asserted directly; on rejection (DNS, timeout, TLS, etc.) the package name is annotated with `(network: <reason>)`, on non-2xx the bare package name is used. Surfaced as STR-INC/H.
- **Empty `harnesses: {}` is no longer accepted as a valid manifest.** `isNewManifest` previously iterated `Object.values(harnesses)` and vacuously returned `true` for the zero-entry case. A truncated/partial write produced a file that loaded "successfully" — then uninstall would iterate zero harness entries, delete the manifest, and report `UluOps has been removed` while leaving every MCP config, agent, hook, and shell export in place. `isNewManifest` now requires at least one harness entry. Surfaced as SEM-COM/H.
- **`validateManifest` no longer emits a false "Cannot read manifest file" warning when the manifest came from legacy.** `loadManifest` migrates a legacy manifest in memory without writing it back to the new location, but `validateManifest` hardcoded `getManifestPath()` (new) for the hash check — the read failed on every uninstall after migration, training users to ignore real corruption signals. The hash verification now reads whichever manifest file actually exists (new path tried first, legacy as fallback) and silently skips when neither is on disk. The "modified since installation" hash-mismatch warning is preserved for the genuine tamper case. Surfaced as SEM-INC/H.
- **`npm install -g` and `npm uninstall -g` now timeout after 5 minutes.** Both `defaultExecutor` (in `src/steps/cli.ts`) and `defaultAgentMetricsExecutor` (in `src/steps/agent-metrics-cli.ts`) called `spawnSync` without a `timeout` option. A corporate proxy stall, registry slow-response storm, or a lifecycle script awaiting input could block setup indefinitely with no recovery path other than `^C`. Both executors now use a 5-minute upper bound, and the `detect` paths use a 30-second bound. Timeout-driven SIGTERM produces a clear `npm install exceeded 300s timeout and was terminated` error instead of a misleading exit-code failure. Surfaced as SEM-COM/H.
- **Windows/WSL path resolution for `@uluops/agent-metrics`.** `findMetricsSource` in `src/steps/metrics.ts` accessed `new URL('.', resolved).pathname` to derive the package root from `import.meta.resolve`. On Windows (including WSL when a path surfaces through a Windows mount), `.pathname` yields `/C:/path/...` — the leading slash before the drive letter is invalid, the subsequent `readFile(pkgRoot/package.json)` fails, and `findMetricsSource` returns `null` with `version: null`, defeating verify's drift detection. Now uses `fileURLToPath(resolved)` from `node:url`, which handles drive letters correctly. Surfaced as SEM-COR/H.
- **`acquireInstallLock` now creates the parent `~/.uluops/` directory before the atomic lock-dir mkdir.** First-time users with no `~/.uluops/` on disk hit `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/home/.../.uluops/install.lock'` from `acquireInstallLock` because the lock-dir mkdir uses `recursive: false` (intentional — `mkdir` atomicity is the lock primitive) and ENOENT on the missing parent is not the same as EEXIST on the lock itself. The parent is now pre-created with `recursive: true` while the lock-dir mkdir keeps its atomicity contract. Surfaced by the new `docker/scenarios/fresh-install.sh` substrate on its very first run against a clean WSL-shaped Ubuntu container — exactly the bug class that local `npm test` cannot reproduce because dev machines always have `~/.uluops/` from prior runs. Regression test pinned at `src/test/install-lock.test.ts`.

### Internal

- 17 new regression tests across the affected modules:
  - 5 for the `agent-metrics` detect fix (covering present/absent/unrelated-deps/missing-version/unparseable-stdout shapes of `npm ls -g --json`).
  - `src/test/config-merger.test.ts` — `checkMcpPackageAvailability` rejection-reason annotation + bare-package-name on registry miss (2 tests, mocked `fetch`).
  - `src/test/manifest.test.ts` — empty-harnesses rejection + legacy-only validate no-false-warning + hash-mismatch tamper detection (3 tests).
  - `src/test/cli.test.ts` — `summarizeSpawnResult` SIGTERM-timeout recognition + stderr-on-non-zero + clean-exit ok-path (3 tests, real subprocesses with tight timeouts).
  - `src/test/harnesses.test.ts` — opencode module-load no-throw under invalid XDG + `assertOpencodeEnvironment` throws on demand + claude-code selection unaffected (3 tests with `vi.resetModules`).
- `summarizeSpawnResult` exported as `@internal` from `src/steps/cli.ts` for direct test access to the timeout branch.
- `assertOpencodeEnvironment` exported from `src/harnesses/opencode.ts` and invoked from `getProfile` in the harness registry.
- 1 install-lock test for the missing-parent-dir regression on first-time users.
- Suite: 223 → 240 tests (+17).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Process-level install lock.** `runSetup` and `runUninstall` now acquire `~/.uluops/install.lock/` before touching shared state. A second concurrent `npx @uluops/setup` (or `uluops-setup --uninstall`) running on the same machine now fails fast with a clear message naming the holding PID, hostname, and how long it has been running — instead of silently racing the read-merge-write windows on `~/.claude.json`, `~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.bashrc`/`.zshrc`, and `~/.uluops/manifest.json` (six surfaces, not the one originally identified). Surfaced by ship-pipeline code-auditor as AF-006 on `uluops-setup` run #19. Hand-rolled around `mkdir`-atomicity — no new runtime dependency. Lock metadata `{pid, hostname, startedAt}` is written inside the lock dir; stale locks are reclaimed when the holding PID is detected as dead (same host) or when the lock is older than 30 minutes (cross-host fallback). SIGINT/SIGTERM/uncaughtException all release the lock before exit. Dry-run is read-only and bypasses the lock.
- **`agent-metrics` CLI prompt.** Setup now offers to install `@uluops/agent-metrics` globally so the `agent-metrics` command is available on PATH after install — previously the package was copied into `~/.claude/tools/agent-metrics/` only so the SubagentStop hook could invoke `dist/hook.js`, but the `bin` entry never reached PATH and users hit `command not found` when trying to inspect captures. The prompt fires only when the metrics hook itself was configured (i.e., when there are captures to read). New `--with-agent-metrics-cli` and `--no-agent-metrics-cli` flags mirror the existing `--with-cli` / `--no-cli` pair. Non-interactive runs (`--yes`, `--api-key`, no TTY) skip the prompt and require the explicit flag to install. Manifest gains `agentMetricsCliInstalled` + `agentMetricsCliInstalledVersion`; uninstall reverses the global install only when this setup performed it (same ownership rule as `@uluops/cli`).

### Known limitations

- **Setup-vs-harness races remain unaddressed.** This lock excludes other `uluops-setup` processes only. If the user is actively using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or OpenCode while running setup, the harness CLI may write to its own state file (e.g. `~/.claude.json`) concurrently with our read-merge-write, and those harness writes can still be lost. A future spec will address this via content compare-and-swap on the merge target. Mitigation today: close the harness CLI before running setup.

### Internal

- New `src/lib/install-lock.ts` (~220 lines) with `acquireInstallLock`, `LockHandle.release()`, `InstallLockHeldError`, signal-handler registration, and a test seam for handler reset.
- New `src/lib/paths.ts:getInstallLockDir()` reusing `getUluopsDir()`.
- 11 unit tests in `src/test/install-lock.test.ts` covering acquire/release, fail-fast on held lock, stale-by-dead-PID, stale-by-timeout, stale-by-corrupt-meta, stale-by-missing-meta, `waitMs` polling success and timeout, idempotent release, and cross-host lock semantics.
- 1 integration test in `src/test/install-lock-integration.test.ts` spawning two real child `node` processes against the compiled dist — true OS-level concurrency serializes as expected.
- `src/cli.ts` formats `InstallLockHeldError` with a hint about stale-lock auto-recovery rather than emitting a stack trace.
- New `src/steps/agent-metrics-cli.ts` mirrors `src/steps/cli.ts` — `AgentMetricsCliExecutor` interface with `detect`/`install`/`uninstall`, `installAgentMetricsCli` + `uninstallAgentMetricsCli`, executor injection for tests.
- New `configureAgentMetricsCliStep` helper in `src/commands/helpers.ts` carries the decision matrix and user-facing prompt; `runSetup` invokes it after `configureMetricsStep`, gated on `metricsResult.hookConfigured`.
- 11 unit tests in `src/test/agent-metrics-cli.test.ts` covering install (already-present, success, failure, post-install detect miss, dryRun) and uninstall (absent, present, post-uninstall recovery, persistent failure, dryRun).
- Suite: 200 → 223 tests (+23 total for this release — 12 from install-lock + 11 from agent-metrics-cli).

## [0.6.5] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **`.gitignore` no longer clobbered when `.gitignore` exists but cannot be read.** The previous `addToGitignore` (`src/steps/mcp.ts`) wrapped the `readFile` call in a bare `catch {}` that unconditionally wrote a single-line file. `ENOENT` was the intended trigger — the catch path exists to create `.gitignore` when it doesn't exist yet — but `EACCES`, `EISDIR`, `EBUSY`, and transient I/O errors were silently treated the same way, destroying any existing user content. The new `ensureGitignoreEntry` helper discriminates `err.code === "ENOENT"` for the fresh-write path and warns-and-skips on all other read errors. Surfaced by ship-pipeline code-auditor as AF-002 on `uluops-setup` run #19. The function is now exported from `src/steps/mcp.ts` with an injectable `reader` parameter so the non-ENOENT-no-clobber contract is directly testable.
- **Shell-profile fence handling now collapses duplicate UluOps blocks** left by earlier buggy installs. `writeShellExport` and `removeShellExport` in `src/steps/shell.ts` used `content.indexOf(FENCE_END)` (first occurrence) while a code comment at line 45 explicitly claimed "use last FENCE_END after FENCE_START to handle duplicates". The mismatch meant: (a) on re-install, the new block replaced only the first half of a duplicate-block region, leaving a stale block — and its stale `ULUOPS_API_KEY` export — sitting below the new one; (b) on uninstall, the second block was never removed. Both sites now use `content.lastIndexOf(FENCE_END)`. Surfaced by code-auditor as a SEM-INC/H finding.

### Internal

- New `ensureGitignoreEntry` tests in `src/test/mcp.test.ts` covering ENOENT (file creation), append-to-existing, idempotency on already-present entry, and the regression guard — non-ENOENT read failure must not clobber existing content.
- New `writeShellExport` and `removeShellExport` tests in `src/test/shell.test.ts` covering the duplicate-fence-block scenario for both install and uninstall.
- Suite now 200 cases (+12).

## [0.6.4] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **`validateKey()` now hits the correct self-identity endpoint.** Server
  validation called `GET /api/v1/registry/users/me` — the registry-api's
  public user-lookup route, which Zod-validates the path param as a UUID and
  returns `400 { id: ["Invalid uuid"] }` for the literal `me`. Endpoint has
  been wrong since the initial `feat: implement @uluops/setup zero-friction
  installer` (commit `70a01a2`); users hit it any time they ran setup with a
  freshly-minted key and no `--skip-validation`. Now points at
  `GET /api/v1/auth/me` (ops-uluops-api) and unwraps the
  `{ data: { email, ... } }` envelope. Five regression tests added covering
  URL, header, response unwrap, 401 path, 500 path, and network-failure path.

### Changed

- **Stopped stamping backend URLs into MCP host configs.** Previously
  `mergeUluopsMcp` (Claude) and the OpenCode harness wrote
  `ULUOPS_BASE_URL: "https://api.uluops.ai/api/v1"` for `uluops-tracker` and
  `ULUOPS_REGISTRY_URL: "https://api.uluops.ai/api/v1/registry"` for
  `uluops-registry` into every generated config. Both URLs are already
  resolved automatically by `@uluops/ops-mcp` / `@uluops/registry-mcp` via
  their bundled SDKs (prod by default), so stamping was redundant — and
  worse, would pin every user to a static URL that could go stale if our
  production endpoints ever shifted. The generated `env` block now contains
  only `ULUOPS_API_KEY`. Pairs with `@uluops/ops-mcp@0.2.1` which made
  `ULUOPS_BASE_URL` officially optional on the consumer side.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- **Setup now auto-detects the installed harness** when `--harness` was not passed explicitly. Previously the detection logic ran but its result was discarded — every default invocation wrote Claude Code-shaped config regardless of what was actually present. A Gemini-CLI-only user running `npx @uluops/setup` from the landing page no longer ends up with an inert `~/.claude/` tree.
  - One harness detected → use it silently (no message for Claude Code to keep the common case quiet; a dim "Detected … — using as target" line for the other harnesses).
  - Multiple harnesses detected → interactive runs prompt with a `select`; non-interactive runs (`--yes`, `--api-key`, no TTY) default to the first match and print a hint about `--harness`.
  - No harnesses detected → fall back to `claude-code` (preserves the landing-page "just works" promise for fresh installs).
  - `--harness <name>` passed explicitly → always honored, detection is skipped.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- **New users now get an "Are you creating a new account?" prompt as the first interactive question** instead of being dropped straight into an API-key input box. Default Y. Picking Y runs the email + password signup flow; picking n falls through to the existing API-key prompt. Eliminates the friction where the landing-page instruction (`npx @uluops/setup`) hit new users with a key prompt before they had any idea where to get a key.
- The new prompt is skipped automatically when the user has already provided a signal about who they are: `--api-key`, `--signup`, `--yes`, `ULUOPS_API_KEY` set in env, no TTY attached, or `~/.uluops/credentials.json` already on disk. Returning users see zero new prompts.
- `--signup` is preserved as an explicit override (skips the question, goes straight to signup) — useful for CI scripts or anyone who wants to bypass the confirm step.

### Added

- **`hasCredentialsFile()` exported from `steps/auth.ts`** — existence-only probe for `~/.uluops/credentials.json` used by the prompt-skip gate.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- **MCP package names switched to scoped `@uluops/*` form.** Setup now writes `npx -y @uluops/ops-mcp` and `npx -y @uluops/registry-mcp` into harness configs (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) instead of the legacy `uluops-tracker-mcp-client` / `uluops-registry-mcp-client` names. The MCP server names in config (`uluops-tracker`, `uluops-registry`) are unchanged — every `mcp__uluops-tracker__*` reference across the agent corpus keeps working. Only the npm package resolved by `npx` differs.
- **`checkMcpPackageAvailability` updated** to probe the new package names against the npm registry. Users who run setup before the two MCP packages are published will see the warning name the actual missing packages.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Optional global `@uluops/cli` install during setup.** New `--with-cli` flag forces install without prompting; `--no-cli` forces skip. With neither flag, interactive runs prompt (default Y) and non-interactive runs (`--yes`, `--api-key`, no TTY) skip silently. The install step is best-effort — if `npm install -g` fails (permissions, nvm prefix surprise, network), setup surfaces a warning with the one-line cause and a manual install command, but the overall flow does not abort. If `ulu` is already on PATH, the step detects it and makes no changes. `manifest.cliInstalled` records ownership, so `--uninstall` removes the global package only when this setup installed it.
- **LICENSE file (MIT).** Aligns the setup package with the open-tooling stance for SDKs/CLIs/installers (proprietary surfaces remain in analytics/platform/tier-gate). `package.json` license field updated to `"MIT"` to match.

### Fixed

- **`dist/commands/**` was missing from the `files` field.** `cli.js` imports `runSetup`, `runUninstall`, and `runVerify` from `./commands/*`, but the `files` array shipped only `dist/cli`, `dist/lib`, `dist/steps`, and `dist/harnesses`. The v0.5.0 tarball crashed on first invocation with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before any user-visible output. v0.5.0 was never published to npm, so no consumers were affected.

### Changed

- **All `dependencies` and `devDependencies` pinned to exact versions** — removed caret ranges across the board (`@inquirer/prompts`, `@uluops/agent-metrics`, `chalk`, `commander`, `jsonc-parser`, and all dev tooling). Aligns this package with the UluOps-wide exact-pinning policy adopted 2026-06-01 in response to the RedHat-class supply-chain attack pattern.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`hooksInstalledVersion` field on `HarnessManifest`** — records the agent-metrics version copied into the harness tree. The shared version ledger across the setup↔agent-metrics seam that the Confucius forecaster named as the missing piece.
- **`HarnessInstanceKey` type alias on `Manifest.harnesses`** — documents that today's `{profile.name}` keying assumes one install per profile, and names where future multi-instance support would extend.
- **`HarnessStatus` field on `HarnessProfile` (`"stable" | "experimental"`)** — `detectHarnesses()` now excludes experimental profiles so auto-detection never returns a profile that throws `HarnessNotTestedError`. Codex marked experimental; Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode marked stable. `getProfile()` still resolves experimental profiles so `--harness <name>` surfaces the explicit error.
- **`CLAUDE_HOOK_TYPES` and `DEFAULT_CLAUDE_HOOK_TYPE` exported** with anchor tests that surface drift in PR review. When Claude Code's hook schema evolves, the snapshot tests fail and point at downstream surfaces needing re-evaluation.

### Changed

- **`@uluops/agent-metrics` moved from `optionalDependencies` to `dependencies`** — it was always required for the headline metrics-hook feature; the optionality was a runtime-level skip for harnesses without hook support, not a declaration-level optionality. `installMetrics` still gracefully skips for OpenCode/Codex.
- **`copyToolFiles` now `rm -rf`s `dist/` before copying** — replaces instead of merges. Stale files from a previous agent-metrics version no longer persist on disk to shadow new files.
- **`verify` now reads the installed agent-metrics version** and compares it to the manifest's `hooksInstalledVersion`. Existence-only check is gone; drift surfaces as a verify failure with the version delta in the detail string.
- **`ULUOPS_HOOK_MARKER` renamed to `HOOK_OWNERSHIP_SIGNATURE`** and its value changed from `"tools/agent-metrics"` (path-coupled) to `"agent-metrics/dist/hook.js"` (suffix-based, path-independent). Existing hook commands match the new signature because all real commands end with this suffix; the rename makes the path/sentinel separation explicit in the type.
- **`getBackupDir` JSDoc** now discloses that backups cover config files only, not tool files in `~/.claude/tools/agent-metrics/`.

### Tracker

- Closes 11 of 12 Confucius-pair findings on this package. The remaining one (metrics-terminology overspecialization) is deferred — speculative rename pending the SubagentStop hook actually gaining non-metric responsibilities.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **agent-metrics dependency stuck at `^0.2.0`** — bumped to `^0.4.0` so `npx @uluops/setup` installs the v0.4.0 hook (slug-drop fix + explicit-tag-only detection). Previously, the caret range resolved to `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0`, silently excluding both v0.3.x and v0.4.x. Setup users were receiving a hook two minor versions behind npm. Closes the declarative form of the install.sh "stuck at v0.1.0" trap surfaced by Confucius analyst/forecaster runs on this package.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Gemini CLI command support**: Commands, workflows, and pipelines now install as `.toml` files for Gemini CLI via transform-at-install (no per-harness asset duplication)
- **Pipelines namespace**: New `pipelines/` subdirectory for pipeline commands (ship, aristotle)
- **Agent transform-at-install**: Single source of truth for agent assets — frontmatter is transformed per harness at install time (Claude Code passthrough, Gemini CLI tool name mapping + envelope, OpenCode permission mapping)
- `anxiety-reader` agent added to starter pack (required by ship pipeline)

### Changed

- Agent assets flattened from `assets/agents/{harness}/` to `assets/agents/` (single source, -19K lines)
- `ship` pipeline moved from `workflows/` to `pipelines/` (correctly classified as PDL)
- `aristotle` pipeline moved from `workflows/` to `pipelines/` and regenerated from PDL source
- Pipeline assets regenerated from actual PDL sources (were incorrectly WDL-rendered)
- Commands install expanded to 3 subdirs: `agents/`, `workflows/`, `pipelines/`
- Starter pack: 23 agents, 23 agent commands, 3 workflows, 2 pipelines

### Fixed

- 30 validation issues resolved across 4 commits (type safety, test coverage, dead code, security)
- Manifest contentHash self-referential bug fixed
- `readCredentialsFile` now throws on malformed JSON instead of swallowing
- Dev dependency vulnerabilities resolved (picomatch, postcss, vite)
- Shell profile fence marker ordering guard added
- MCP config backups now timestamped to prevent overwrites
- Strict unused checks enabled in test tsconfig

- Harness aliases (`claude`, `oc`, `gemini`)
- Manifest-based installation tracking with per-harness state
- Atomic writes for all config file modifications
- Backup creation before config changes
- Dynamic agent/workflow catalog derived from assets at runtime

### Changed
- Renamed `/agents:validate` to `/agents:code-validate` for naming clarity
- Config files containing API keys now written with 0o600 permissions (owner-only)
- readConfig/readSettings now throw on malformed JSON instead of silently returning empty object
- Hook command paths are now quoted to handle spaces in installation paths
- .gitignore writes use atomic write pattern for crash safety
- Extracted display functions to dedicated module (cli.ts reduced from 758 to 647 lines)

### Fixed
- Package name misattribution in MCP availability check when fetch rejects
- Hardcoded TOOL_COUNT and AGENT_LIST replaced with dynamic asset scanning

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
